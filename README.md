# fastApiCRUDOperations
Using FastAPI, Python and MongoDB, I have designed a simple backend server to perform CRUD operations on 2 separate databases: User Database and Product Database.

You can: 1. Create a new instance, 2. search for an existing instance, 3.  update an existing instance, 4. delete an existing instance, 5. search for all existing instances in both the databases, separately!

This project has been made with the help of the following tools ---> dnspython, pymongo, uvicorn, fastapi.

Please ensure you install the above tools before working on the project for full functionality.
Lastly, these are some screenshots of my completed project.
I am sharing screenshots of Swagger UI, but feel free to use any other development environment.
